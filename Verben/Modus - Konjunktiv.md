The **subjunctive** (also known as **conjunctive** in some languages) is a grammatical mood that indicates the speaker's attitude toward it. Subjunctive forms of  [[Verben]] are typically used to express various states of unreality such as: wish, emotion, possibility, judgment, opinion, obligation, or action that has not yet occurred.

German has two forms of the subjunctive mood, namely [[Konjunktiv I - present subjunctive]] and [[Konjunktiv II - past subjunctive]]. Despite their English names, both German subjunctives can be used for past and present time.
