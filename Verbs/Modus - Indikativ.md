The **Modus Indikativ** is, along with the [[Modus - Imperativ]] and the [[Modus - Konjunktiv I]], one of the three grammatical modes of the verbs in German.

The indicative is the "normal" expression of the mode, whereas special conditions apply or special meanings are responsible for the appearance of the subjunctive and imperative.

As a neutral mode form, the indicative is also the most common, and it can be identified in all languages of the world, although there are different systems with different mode contrasts.

As a neutral mode, it is also available in combination with all other grammatical categories of the verb (active/passive, present/past/future). The appearance of a subjunctive, on the other hand, is rather limited, for example in [Latin](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateinische_Grammatik "Latin grammar") there is no indicative-subjunctive distinction in the future tense and future forms are always indicative there.

**Modus Indikativ** is made by the following tenses:
[[Indikativ - Präsens]]
[[Indikativ - Perfekt]]
[[Indikativ - Präteritum]]
[[Indikativ - Plusquamperfekt]]
[[Indikativ - Futur I]]
[[Indikativ - Futur II]]
