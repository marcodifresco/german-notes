# Marco Di Fresco's personal German notes
Welcome to the repository for my German's notes. I am studying German at 
[Klubschule Migros](https://www.klubschule.ch/) in Zurich and I am taking these notes during class to help myself in learning the language.

To use my notes:

1. Click on the three dots above on the right and select *"Download repository"*;

2. Unzip the downloaded zip file where you want;

3. Download [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and install it;

4. Open *Obsidian* and on the main window select *"Open folder as vault"* and select the folder where you exacted the zip file.

I update the notes quite often. To update your copy, you can just repeat step #1 and extract the zip file on the same directory of the previous version. If you are familiar with *git*, you can use the *"Clone"* option above and from time to time do a *git pull*.

If you find any mistake in my notes, please open a ticket [here](https://bitbucket.org/marcodifresco/german-notes/issues)
